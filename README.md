## Project 1: [Movie Recommendation System](https://movies-recommendation-system-bbcd81475afd.herokuapp.com)
##### Developed content based recommendation system that provides movie suggestions based on user preferences.
* Merged two datasets of 4800 movies and dug out suitable features for our system and performed Data Preprocessing.
* Combined all important features (genres/keywords/actors/directors) into one column and converted them into vectors.
* Model was trained to find top-5 similar movies on the basis of distances between each vectors using Cosine similarity.
* Created a basic Web application with user-friendly interface for enhanced user interaction using Streamlit.



## Project 2: [Portfolio Optimization](https://portfolio-optomization-605bcecc5cc2.herokuapp.com)
##### Implemented a algorithm to find the optimal allocation of assets that aims to maximize returns while minimizing risk.
* Gathered real-time data of multiple stocks prices starting from FY'22 using python library to access Yahoo Finance API.
* Calculated Sharpe Ratio which compares the return with risk using Expected Portfolio Returns and Volatility.
* Employed Monte Carlo algorithm as it is suitable for risk assessment, risk management and decision analysis.
* Implemented an optimization algorithm, Sequential Least Square Programming(SLSQP) using scipy.optimization
